# ATD_Counter_App

# This is made as a compliment for a project in IAT 312, Fall 2018.
# A counter-like app for a physical prototype of a tower defense redesign: Antlion Tower Defense. It keeps track of how much currency the player has spent thus far in setting up their defense, the current turn, and gives general updates. It's intended purpose is to be used as a tool alongside the physical board game.
